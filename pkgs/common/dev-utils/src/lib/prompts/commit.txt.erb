Generate a commit message from a diff and an optional title. You should
rewrite and improve the title in case it's present. The commit message should contain a
title and an explanation of how that changelog accomplishes the objective in
the title separated by one blank line.

<% if conventional_prefix != nil %>
The generated title should start with "<%= conventional_prefix %>:", which must be followed by a non-capitalized verb in imperative form.
<% else %>
The generated title must not be prefixed with anything, but it must start with a capitalized verb in imperative form.
<% end %>

Example output:
```
<% if conventional_prefix != nil %>
<%= conventional_prefix %>: improve the README
<% else %>
Improve the README
<% end %>

This commit improves the README by clarifying the purpose of the project.
```

<% if title != "" %>
Title: <%= title %>
<% end %>

```
<%= diff %>
```
