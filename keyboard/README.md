The keyboard layout is an adapted version of "US international" that favors English, Portuguese, German and Esperanto. The adaptations are in the composed keys, which are defined in `XCompose`.

In order for GTK+ to abide by this configuration, an environment variable must be set in `.bashrc`, which is done in the `bashrc_ibus` file.

FIXME: the esperanto key doesn't currently work with GTK+
