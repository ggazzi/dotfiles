* Introduction

This is my n-th restart of my emacs config.

** How does this config work?

This is a literate configuration, that is, code is interspersed with text.
The structure of this document should be readable by humans.
Pieces of code are then weaved together into the appropriate source files, resulting in a functional emacs configuration.

Since this is a Doom Emacs config, it involves three files:

- =init.el=: imports the Doom Emacs configuration modules.
  Its structure and most of its content is contained in its [[#doom-modules][own section]].
- =packages.el=: declares packages that should be installed by Doom's package management system.
  It is also mostly contained in its [[#package-loading][own section]].
- =config.el=: contains the bulk of the config and is loaded last.

The weaving/tangling itself is supported by Doom Emacs's [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/modules/config/literate/README.org][=literate=]] module, generating the Emacs configuration from the =$DOOM_DIR/config.org= file instead of the aforementioned three files.

All =emacs-lisp= code blocks are tangled to =config.el= unless otherwise specified.
This can be overridden by setting the header option ~:tangle "destination/file.el"~ to write to another file, or ~:tangle no~ to avoid tangling this code block.

Moreover, blocks can be named and then weaved into other blocks using a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][noweb-style syntax]].
The named block should have the option ~:tangle no~ and be preceded by a line with ~#+name: BLOCK-NAME~.
Then it can be weaved into another code block that contains ~<<BLOCK-NAME>>~, as long as the option ~:noweb no-export~ is given.
This ensures that the weaving takes place when tangling code, but not when exporting the whole document as a PDF or HTML.

Most code blocks in this document are indeed tangled directly into the =config.el= file.
The structure of =init.el= is defined by a single code block in the [[#doom-modules][section on Doom modules]].
Finally, the content of =packages.el= is distributed throughout the configuration is blocks with the appropriate ~:tangle~ option, so that the loading and configuration of a package are close together.

Since we are already talking about literate programming and named blocks, we might as well provide the named block here for importing the ~literate~ module.
It will be weaved into the [[#doom-modules][section on Doom modules]].

#+name: doom-literate
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
literate
#+end_src


* Initial setup

This file should use lexical binding. Obviously.
This is the only sane default.
Also, apparently [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][it is (slightly) faster]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

The =packages.el= file shouldn't be byte compiled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;;; packages.el -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+end_src

** Personal information

It's useful to have some basic personal information.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Guilherme Grochau Azzi"
      user-mail-address "gazzi@babbel.com")
#+end_src


** Better defaults

The following is based on my previous configurations, [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#rudimentary-configuration][tecosaur/emacs-config]] and [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]].


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t         ; Delete files to trash instead of permanently
 window-combination-resize t         ; When resizing the frame, resize all windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t                  ; Stretch cursor to glyph width
 fill-column 90                      ; I like 90-char width lines
 indent-tabs-mode nil                ; Stop using tabs!
 tab-width 4                         ; Use 4-space indents by default (in some languages I override it)
 sentence-end-double-space t)        ; I like using double spaces after the end of a sentence


(setq auto-save-default t            ; Plase don't lose my work.
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…"   ; Unicode is cute and compact 😀
      scroll-margin 10)              ; Maintain a generous margin. As Tim Minchin illustrated nicely, context is important.

(global-subword-mode 1)              ; Navigate through camelCase and snake_case words

#+end_src

Besides that, since I am using Doom Emacs, I will take advantage of its nicer defaults.

#+name: doom-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(default +bindings +smartparens)
#+end_src


** Doom modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:CUSTOM_ID: doom-modules
:END:

Doom has a nice /modular configuration base/ providing great configuration defaults.
Using their [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/modules.org][existing modules]] saves me a lot of work.
For my own config, however, I'd rather use a monolithic but literate approach.

Doom modules are configured in the =init.el= file, whose structure is defined by the following code block.
The actual configuration is defined in the following subsections and weaved in.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el :noweb no-export :comments no
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'C-c c k' on a module to view its documentation,
;; and 'C-c c d' to browse its directory.

**** Everything in Emacs

I don't do everything in Emacs.
But I could if I wanted to...

#+end_src


* User interface

** Visual settings

*** Theme and modeline

Here I can set my preferred colour theme.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-molokai)
#+end_src

I hate the red file names in the modeline when the buffer has been modified and not saved.
Make it orange instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

*** Font faces

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 12)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 25 :weight 'regular)

      ;doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans" :size 16 :weight 'light)
      ;doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code")
      ;doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "Noto Serif")
      )
#+end_src


** Keyboard

*** Better search

I like the evil keybindings for searching, but I want better search functions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-motion-state-map
      "/" #'consult-line
      "?" #'consult-line-multi)
#+end_src

*** Manual indentation

Sometimes, the automatic indentation tries to be cleverer than it is.
Thus, I also want easy access to manual indentation commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader
      :prefix "c"
      :nv "TAB" #'indent-rigidly)
#+end_src

** Frames, buffers and windows

*** Buffers

I could use some prettier buffer names.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src

**** TODO Improve buffer names when filename is the same but directory differs

*** Frame title

I'd like to have just the current buffer name, then if applicable the project folder.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

*** Limiting buffer width

I want tools to restrict the width of frames and soft-wrap lines, but not necessarily put me into a strict "single-buffer" layout to focus on writing like ~zen~ and ~writeroom~ do.
A simple alternative is ~olivetti-mode~, which I enable by default for a few modes.
I also make sure that it is adjusted to the ~fill-column~, so that it is compatible with automatic formatting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! olivetti)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! olivetti
  :hook
   ((olivetti-mode . (lambda () (setq-local olivetti-body-width fill-column))))
  :config
  (setq olivetti-body-width fill-column))

(map! :after olivetti
      :leader
      :prefix ("v" . "olivetti")
      :n "t" #'olivetti-mode
      :n "v" #'olivetti-mode

      :map olivetti-mode-map
      :leader
      :prefix ("v" . "olivetti")
      :n ">" #'olivetti-expand
      :n "<" #'olivetti-shrink
      :n "w" #'olivetti-set-width)
#+end_src


* Org mode

** General appearance

To help focus on the text, I'll remove line numbers, limit line width and display centred using ~olivetti-mode~.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! org-mode #'+org-pretty-mode #'olivetti-mode)
(add-hook! org-mode (display-line-numbers-mode -1))
#+end_src

*** Headings, titles and lists

The headings and title can be improved to follow some [[https://practicaltypography.com/headings.html][good typographical practices]].
I've taken the sizes of headings mostly from [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/#font-display][tecosaur]].
I also replace the bullets displayed along with headings into something more subtle.
Bullets for headings and for list items are prettified by [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][~org-superstar-mode~]], though I change the heading bullets into something more subtle.
I also change the character for collapsed items.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.5)
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold)
  '(org-superstar-header-bullet :height 1.2))
(setq org-ellipsis "…"
      org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "*") ("*" . "-") ("1." . "a.")))
#+end_src

When I'm editing in the middle of a file, I also like to display the parent headers at the top of the buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el :noweb-ref nil
(package! org-sticky-header)
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package! org-sticky-header
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-sticky-header-mode)
    :custom
    (org-sticky-header-full-path 'full)
    (org-sticky-header-outline-path-separator " ჻ ")
    (org-sticky-header-prefix "჻ ")
    (org-sticky-header-heading-star ""))
#+end_src

*** Markup

While using markup to format the text is very practical, it is not the prettiest or most readable.
The =org-appear= package solves this by hiding the markup, unless the cursor is on/within it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el :noweb-ref nil
(package! org-appear)
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers nil
        org-appear-autolinks t))
#+end_src

We can have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src


* Manual pages

Emacs provides extensive documentation, which is helpful but not always nice to look at.
Fortunately, doom emacs already improves this a lot by adding colours!
I also limit the width and center contents on the buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (Info-mode helpful-mode)
  (olivetti-mode)
  (olivetti-set-width 100))
#+end_src


* Languages

** Nix

Nix files work best with 2-space indendation.
Also, this is what the =rnix-lsp= does.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! nix-mode
  (add-hook! nix-mode
    (lambda () (setq-local standard-indent 2))))
#+end_src

I use flakes for pretty much every project I touch.
A good template saves me some time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list '+file-templates-alist
             '("/flake\\.nix$" :trigger "__flake.nix"))
#+end_src
