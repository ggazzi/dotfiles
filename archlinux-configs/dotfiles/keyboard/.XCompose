# Use the sequences from en_US.UTF-8 as the basis:
include "/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"

# This one should probably be deleted, because in
# en_US.UTF8 this is lowercase schwa, not uppercase:
<Multi_key> <e> <e> 			: "Ə" U018f

# Two nice additions -- maybe add to en_US.UTF8?
<Multi_key> <quotedbl> <backslash> 	: "〝" U301d	# REVERSED DOUBLE PRIME QUOTATION MARK
<Multi_key> <quotedbl> <slash>  	: "〞" U301e	# DOUBLE PRIME QUOTATION MARK

#  Overriding C with acute for portuguese:
<dead_acute> <C> 			: "Ç" Ccedilla	# LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
<dead_acute> <c> 			: "ç" ccedilla	# LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA

#  Overriding U with circumflex for esperanto:
<dead_circumflex> <U>   : "Ŭ"   U016C # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH BREVE
<dead_circumflex> <u>   : "ŭ"   U016D # LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH BREVE

# These two should probably go back into en_US.UTF8;
# they were most likely mistakenly dropped in June 2006:
<Multi_key> <acute> <U03D2> 		: "ϓ" U03D3	# GREEK UPSILON WITH ACUTE AND HOOK SYMBOL
<Multi_key> <apostrophe> <U03D2> 	: "ϓ" U03D3	# GREEK UPSILON WITH ACUTE AND HOOK SYMBOL
