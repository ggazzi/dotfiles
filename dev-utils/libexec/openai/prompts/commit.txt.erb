Generate a commit message from a diff and an optional title. You should
rewrite and improve the title in case it's present. The commit message should contain a
title and an explanation of how that changelog accomplishes the objective in
the title separated by one blank line.

The generated title should be prefixed with one of the following options. After the prefix should be a non-capitalized verb in imperative form.

- `feat:` if it introduces a new feature to the codebase
- `refactor:` if it improves the code without changing the behaviour of the codebase
- `test:` if it just adds or improves tests
- `fix:` if it fixes a bug in the codebase
- `doc:` if it only touches documentation
- `chore:` if it changes configuration, continuous integration or packaging information

Example output:
```
doc: improve the README

This commit improves the README by clarifying the purpose of the project.
```

<% if title != "" %>
Title: <%= title %>
<% end %>

```
<%= diff %>
```
